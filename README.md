<Mix-and-Fix>

 ## Description
Weâ€™ve created a web application that offers recipes for homemade meals and handmade cocktails.  It targets individuals and families that are tired of searching through countless websites and cookbooks looking for the perfect dinner and after dinner drink.  As a team, we acknowledged the importance of information on the go at the touch of a button.  As career driven individuals and families seem to have less free time than ever, our goal is to provide simple, easy to understand recipes of timeless classics and modern marvels.  Collectively, this entire project has been a learning process of sorts.  Collaborating via zoom has its benefits and detriments and the merging of repository branches is a separate challenge that will become easier with time and experience.

## Usage
To use Mix and Fix, choose one of the four options on the homepage that allow you to browse cocktail recipes, meal recipes, or pick an "I'm Feeling Lucky" random choice. If the user clicks the random option, they will be presented with a random cocktail or meal recipe on the homepage. If the user chooses to browse cocktails or browse meals, they will be brought to that choice's specific page. Here they have the option to search by name or by ingredient. When clicking "Search" on the search by name option, they will be presented with a list of meals or drinks. Then, the user can click the meal or drink of their choice and they will be presented with a recipe for that meal. If they click the "Search" button on search by ingredient, the user will be presented with a list of drink or meal names. They can then type that item name into the name search to retrieve the recipe. The user also has the option to navigate between the home, cocktail, or meals pages on the site. Here is a link to the deployed site! https://rwwoods.github.io/mix-and-fix-recipe-app/

## Credits

This project was created by Kendra Fitzgerald (https://github.com/kendrafitzgerald), Atef Helmy (https://github.com/AtefHelmy), Miles Roman (https://github.com/Myroman81), and Ridge Woods (https://github.com/RWWoods). Moreover, this project utilizes TheCocktailDB API as well as TheMealDB API. The links to each API are https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php and https://www.themealdb.com/api.php , respectively. The entire team worked together to create the index.HTML with some CSS/Bulma styling for the homepage, however once a rough outline was created, responsibilities were divided. Kendra was responsible for creating the HTML, styling, and JavaScript functionality for the cocktail recipe page. She utilized HTML, CSS, Bulma, and TheCocktailDB API to allow the user to search for recipes by name, or drink names by ingredients, and render their results on the page. Atef was responsible for the homepage of the site as well as creating styling and navigation functionality across the website. He utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete these tasks and allow for easier navigation and UI/UX across the app. Miles was responsible for creating the HTML, styling, and JavaScript functionality for the cocktail recipe page. He utilized HTML, CSS, Bulma, and TheMealDB API to allow the user to search for recipes by name, or meal names by ingredients, and render their results on the page. Ridge was responsible for creating and styling the homepage, specfically the "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons. He utilized HTML, JavaScript, and CSS/Bulma to add functionality to these buttons and also utilized local storage so the results of the randomized choices remained on the homepage even when the user navigates to other sections of the site. Overall, our cohort collaborated together to create the app, working individually and as a team to ensure functionality and styling across the board.
